<h2>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</h2>

<ol>
  <li>HTML is cool</li>
  <li>CSS is cooler</li>
  <li>JS is the best</li>
</ol>

<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

<h2>Not much!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)
    A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
